Coca Cola Case study has the dataset which is analysed using excel functions 


I recently worked on an intriguing Coca-Cola stock data analysis case study using Excel. The dataset consisted of columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, providing a comprehensive view of the stock's historical performance.

One of the main tasks was creating pivot tables to analyze key stock metrics like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Pivot tables allowed me to efficiently summarize and reorganize data, providing clear insights into stock trends over time.

In addition, I utilized Excel's IS TEXT and IS NUMBER functions to categorize and analyze the data. This was particularly useful for showing the date associated with specific values, such as 50015919 in the Open column. These functions helped ensure that the data was properly interpreted and categorized, facilitating more accurate analysis.

I also leveraged the power of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions, essential tools for looking up data across rows and columns. These functions were instrumental in pulling specific data points from the dataset, making the process of extracting key information much more efficient.

Overall, this project enhanced my skills in handling real-world stock data and solidified my understanding of Excel's powerful data analysis capabilities. It was an excellent opportunity to refine my ability to work with financial datasets and apply advanced Excel functions.
